## Overview

The WordCount.java program modifies the reduce task to only return pairs that appear more than 20,000 times in the dataset, and the program saves the output as 'result-reut-popular.txt.' The data was scraped from a publication by the [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dx.html) and can be downloaded from [The Ohio State University](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~blanas.2/3244/reuters21578.zip).
